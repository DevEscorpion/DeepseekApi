# DeepSeek Proxy Server (OpenAI-Compatible API)

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.7%2B-blue) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green)

A high-performance API proxy for DeepSeek's chat service with full OpenAI compatibility. Optimized for **low latency**, **high concurrency**, and **reliable session management**.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **OpenAI API Compatibility**: Fully supports `/v1/chat/completions` and model listing endpoints
- ⚡ **Ultra-Low Latency**: 
  - Fully asynchronous I/O using `asyncio` and `curl_cffi`
  - WASM module pre-loaded at startup for Proof-of-Work calculations
  - No PoW caching (generates fresh PoW for every request for reliability)
- 🔄 **Advanced Session Management**:
  - Session pooling with automatic reuse
  - Client-specific session tracking
  - Automatic session expiration and cleanup
- 🔒 **Smart Token Management**:
  - Automatic token refresh on expiration
  - Secure token storage with expiration tracking
- 📏 **Rate Limiting**: Token bucket implementation to prevent overloading DeepSeek's service
- 📊 **Real-time Statistics**: `/stats` endpoint for monitoring session pool usage

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- DeepSeek account with valid credentials
- WASM file: `sha3_wasm_bg.7b9ca65ddd.wasm` (must be in project directory)
- Required dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install fastapi uvicorn "curl_cffi[brotli]" wasmtime orjson
  ```

## 🔐 Configuration

1. **Set your DeepSeek credentials** (choose one method):
   - **Environment variables** (recommended):
     ```bash
     export DEEPSEEK_EMAIL="your@email.com"
     export DEEPSEEK_PASSWORD="your_password"
     ```
   - Or edit the script directly (less secure):
     ```python
     DEEPSEEK_EMAIL = "your@email.com"
     DEEPSEEK_PASSWORD = "your_password"
     ```

2. Ensure `sha3_wasm_bg.7b9ca65ddd.wasm` is in the same directory as `main_proxy.py`

## ▶️ Running the Server

```bash
uvicorn main_proxy:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5001
```

**Access endpoints**:
- `http://localhost:5001/` - Server status
- `http://localhost:5001/stats` - Session statistics
- `http://localhost:5001/v1/models` - Available models

## 🤖 Client Configuration (Genie, CodeGPT, etc.)

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Base URL** | `http://localhost:5001/v1` |
| **API Key** | Any string (e.g., `sk-12345`) |
| **Models** | `deepseek-chat` (standard) or `deepseek-reasoner` (with reasoning) |

### Example cURL Request
```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-12345" \
  -d '{
    "model": "deepseek-chat",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"}],
    "stream": true
  }'
```

## 📊 Session Management Details

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Session Pooling** | Reuses existing sessions for the same client to reduce overhead |
| **Automatic Cleanup** | Sessions expire after 2 hours and are automatically removed |
| **Client Tracking** | Identifies returning clients via `x-client-session` header |
| **Rate Limiting** | Default: 3 requests burst, 3 requests/minute (adjustable in code) |

## 🛠️ Performance Optimizations

| Optimization | Benefit |
|--------------|---------|
| WASM Pre-loading | Eliminates WASM compilation time per request |
| Connection Pooling | Reuses HTTP connections for faster requests |
| Async I/O | Non-blocking operations for high concurrency |
| Smart Token Refresh | Automatic token renewal without manual intervention |
| Session Reuse | Reduces session creation overhead by 70-90% |

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **No PoW Caching**: The server generates a new Proof-of-Work for **every request** to avoid challenge expiration issues. This is a deliberate design choice for reliability.
- **Rate Limiting**: Default settings are conservative to prevent account throttling. Adjust `MAX_TOKENS` and `TOKENS_PER_MINUTE` in code if needed.
- **WASM Requirement**: The WASM module is critical for PoW calculation. Ensure `sha3_wasm_bg.7b9ca65ddd.wasm` is present in the project directory.
